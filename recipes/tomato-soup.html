<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>9 Roma tomatoes sliced lenghtwise</li>
    <li>3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 yellow onion diced</li>
    <li>4 garlic cloves minced</li>
    <li>1 tbsp kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 28 oz. can San Marzano tomatoes crushed</li>
    <li>1 cup basil fresh, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
    <li>2 cups chichen stock</li>
    <li>2/3 cup heavy cream</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375°F</li>
    <li>Spread tomato halves on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil, and then sprinkle with salt and black pepper</li>
    <li>Roast tomatoes for 1 hour. Remove from oven and set aside</li>
    <li>Heat 2 tbsp oil, or butter, in a large pot (or Dutch oven) over medium-high heat</li>
    <li>Add onion, and saute for about 5 minutes</li>
    <li>Stir in the garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper. Sauté for another minute</li>
    <li>Add crushed tomatoes, basil, and sugar to the pot. Lower the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes</li>
    <li>Add the stock and the roasted tomatoes into the pot. Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring every now and then</li>
    <li>Use an immersion blender to purée the soup, or very carefully transfer to a blender or food processor to purée. This would most likely need to be done in a couple batches. Return the soup to the pot</li>
    <li>Stir in the cream</li>
    <li>To make the mini croutons: Cut a few small pieces of bread in small cubes, add a little oil, diced garlic and basil...bake at 400 for about 7 minutes... these make wonderful croutons!</li>
    <li>Add the croutons to the top of the served soup. Serve at once!</li>
</ol>
